A Python code was developed to replicate essential Oscilloscope functions
(p-p voltage, frequency, etc.). The code can be run on both Arduino and
Raspberry Pi platforms. The former requires the PyFirmata Protocol to run the python code, while
the latter requires an Analog-to-Digital Converter(ADS 1115) to read Analog Signals.
The above image shows the output from a 555-timer IC.
